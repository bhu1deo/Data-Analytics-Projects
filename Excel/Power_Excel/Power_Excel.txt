Calculations: Measures

Pivot Table Pivot Charts KPIs

Manage: Core Pivot Interface: Home Tab to import the data

	Get data from all the related files in your database

	Preview the data before adding to the data model, to check correctness

	Before establishing relationships: take a note of the primary and foreign keys in the tables

Establish relationships: Home tab -> Diagram View: Drag on related fields of different tables to establish relationships

	One-Many relationship: Double click to manage the relationship, right click to see all options

	After relationships have been established: we can go back to data view. 

Calculated Columns in the Data View: Add column option is already present (greyed out)

RELATED only works with RELATED tables

Calculated Column for row wise calculations

Measures for aggregate based calculations

Save and close our data view: Then go to original Excel and then Select measures beside the Manage option

Measures can also be added in the Calculation View of the Data View (After clicking Manage)

It's better to add a measure in the power pivot window as all data is visible therein 

New Measure definition: Measure_name:=Formula

Unlike a calculated formula, while defining a measure do not start with an = sign
Directly go for measure name and then := then followed by the formula

Right click and then format, otherwise, we also have a formatting option in the Home Tab

Explicit measures and better (aggregation specified explicitly), measures do not belong to any specific table

Then go back to our original Excel interface and then Insert and then Insert a Pivot Table

Insert Pivot Table from the Data model which we already have : generally we do it from a range or from a table

All connected tables can be pulled into the Pivot Table 

All the pivot table operations are valid henceforth 

Measures can also be pulled into the values field of the pivot table 
The aggregation then depends upon the row level filters applicable in the Pivot table under consideration
Note that summarize values by cannot be changed for measures as they already have an aggregation inbuilt in them 

KPIs: PResent in the Power Pivot Menu (by default when we are working with a Pivot Table, we are in the Pivot Table Menu)

By default KPI values are presented as 0 and 1,-1: Remove and re-add the KPI values in order to see the colored KPI values 

Get Data Transform and Shape and make it analysis ready

See ETL png image

more than million rows in Power Query

powerful transformation tools

all recorded steps can be run by just one click

DAX: Data analysis expressions 

Data tab: To get data from source: One can get data from existing range also

M-code in the formula bar of the Power Query editor

Name the Query appropriately

Applied steps to check before finalizing

Split Delimiter is a useful transformation 


Specifying a column's data-type is different from formatting the values as currency

Home Tab in the Power Query editor-> Close and load to apply the transformations and load the data


Table design options are quite useful

Editable applied steps have a gear icon: 

Data Tab -> Queries and Connections : Right Click to refresh the Query (if new data added/steps changed)

In the Query editor, the rows of the loaded data could be filtered as we do in normal Excel. 

Headers should have the same name before merging the files: good practice

Query Editor -> Home Tab replace values: 

Unpivot cannot be done in Excel without Power Query

Load into power query-> get data from range and then transform tab unpivot columns 

Unpivot columns or sometimes unpivot columns other than the selected columns

Merge Query: Similar to JOIN tables

Append : Add rows Stack Rows

Applied steps can be renamed by right click and rename

using locale setting can be extremely helpful for changing to a date data type for a particular column
sometimes dates are not recognized even after changing the data type of the particular column

In the query editor, expand the pane on the left: Then we can see the Queries Tables 

We can duplicate or reference queries

duplicate: Duplicates 

reference: Exact same query as the original one just do some changes at the end 

Conditional Column, group by one or more columns 

If you are looking to copy an entire query with all of its steps, then Duplicate is your friend.

Reference is another way of copying a query, However, the big difference is that; 
When you reference a query, the new query will have only one step: sourcing from the original query.
 A referenced query, will not have the applied steps of the original query.
